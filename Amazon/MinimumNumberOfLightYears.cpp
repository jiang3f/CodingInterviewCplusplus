We are given N solar systems, each solar system with M planets.We can 
move to any other planet of the same solar system in 1 light year.We 
can move from Mth planet of Kth solar system to 1st planet of (K + 1)th 
solar system in 1 light year. Apart from this we are also given a list 
of wormholes, where each wormhole specifies the entry planet and exit 
planet. Passing through a wormhole would also take 1 light year.

Now given the X-starting planet, and Y-destination planet, we need to 
find the minimum number of light-years that we would take to travel.
